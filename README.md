## **Design of QAM system over the AWGN channel**

- ### **Problem Statement**

        QAM is a digital modulation technique which involves both the
        amplitude as well as phase shift keying. Write a matlab code to simulate
        QAM modulation. Plot the QAM modulated signal as well as the
        constellation diagram.
